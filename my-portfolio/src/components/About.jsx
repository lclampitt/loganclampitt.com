            <p>
              Hi, I’m Logan Clampitt, a Computer Science graduate from California State
              University Fullerton. I’ve been passionate about computers and programming
              from a young age, and I enjoy building clean, functional software while
              continuously improving my skills as a developer.
              <br />
              <br />
              Outside of coding, I have a strong interest in graphic design,
              video editing, and sim racing, where I’ve competed professionally
              for over 8 years. Racing has taught me discipline and focus that I
              apply to both my career and academics.
            </p>
